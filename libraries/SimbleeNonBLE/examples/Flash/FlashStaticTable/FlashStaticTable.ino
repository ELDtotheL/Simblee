This sketch demonstrates how to use a static table
in flash memory on the Simblee instead of RAM.

This sketch is a reimplementation of fade that takes
into account the nonlinear relationship between
brightness and duty cycle.

// does not need to relocate the initialization data from flash to RAM, and
// uses the flash address instead.
